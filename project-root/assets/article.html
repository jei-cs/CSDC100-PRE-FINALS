                  You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? </p>

                  <p>
                    If I were to agree without any prior research, I run the risk of getting subpar results. An iPhone 16 Pro Max, while equipped with advanced camera technology, may not match the quality and versatility of professional-grade cameras used by experienced photographers and videographers. Additionally, CapCut, although a popular video editing app, may lack the advanced features and capabilities of professional editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro. Also, the use of AI tools in the editing process may raise concerns about the authenticity and originality of the final product. The verdict would ultimately depend on the documentation team's expertise in utilizing their creativity, skills, and tools effectively to deliver high-quality results.

                  Me personally, my answer would depend on their whole portfolio and past experiences, also considering their reviews from previous clients and whether or not they have a good reputation in the industry. 
                  I would also consider how they use AI tools in their workflow. If they are using AI tools to enhance their creativity, streamline their editing process, and deliver a high-quality product, I would be more inclined to agree to the deal. However, if they are solely relying on AI tools without showcasing their own skills and creativity, I would be hesitant.
                  The tools they use does not dictate their skill, creativity, and integrity. 40k for a wedding documentation is way more than enough to hire a professional team with high end gears and software, therefore I would expect nothing less than a top tier output. Ultimately, my decision would be based on a combination of their experience, portfolio, reputation, and if they utilize AI tools ethically in their work.
